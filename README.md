# QueueAssignment

Queue Structure
In this assignment you will create and instantiate a class that represents a queue data structure. All code will be written in dotnetfiddle.net (you can write it in Visual Studio first and paste into dotnetfiddle.net) and the URL should be mailed to the teacher by the due date.
Requirements
•	The queue structure must be generic (e.g. instantiated with different data types using the same class)
•	The types the queue contains must be limited to reference types
•	The queue must be limited to containing only 10 items.  If an 11th item is added the program should drop the first added entry … and so on.
•	The queue must have an ‘add’ method to place items on the queue (remember that a queue can only add items to the end of the queue)
•	The queue must have a ‘remove’ method to remove items on the queue.  The remove returns the item removed back to the caller (remember that a queue can only remove from the front of the queue)
